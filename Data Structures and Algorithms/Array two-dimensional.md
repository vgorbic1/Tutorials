## Array (two-dimensional)
A two-dimensional array is really nothing more than just an array of arrays. It is better to think of the two-dimensional array as a 
matrix. A matrix can be thought of as a grid of numbers, arranged in rows and columns.

#### Complexity
access | search | insert | remove 
---|---|---|---
O(1) | O(n) | O(n) | O(n)

** C array declaration **
```java
int[][] myArray = {  {0, 1, 2, 3},
                     {3, 2, 1, 0},
                     {3, 5, 6, 1},
                     {3, 8, 3, 4}  };
```
