## Data Registers

Four 32-bit data registers are used for arithmetic, logical and other operations. These 32-bit registers can be used in 
three ways:
- As complete 32-bit data registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX.
- Lower halves of the 32-bit registers can be used as four 16-bit data registers: AX, BX, CX and DX.
- Lower and higher halves of the above-mentioned four 16-bit registers can be used as eight 8-bit data 
registers: AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL:
