## Data Registers

Four 32-bit data registers are used for arithmetic, logical and other operations. These 32-bit registers can be used in 
three ways:
- As complete 32-bit data registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX.
- Lower halves of the 32-bit registers can be used as four 16-bit data registers: AX, BX, CX and DX.
- Lower and higher halves of the above-mentioned four 16-bit registers can be used as eight 8-bit data 
registers: AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL, DH, and DL.

- **AX** is the primary accumulator; it is used in input/output and most arithmetic instructions. For example, in multiplication operation, one operand is stored in EAX or AX or AL register according to the size of the operand.
- **BX** is known as the base register as it could be used in indexed addressing.
- **CX** is known as the count register as the ECX, CX registers store the loop count in iterative operations.
- **DX** is known as the data register. It is also used in input/output operations. It is also used with AX register along with DX for multiply and divide operations involving large values.
