## Application Flow

### The Big Picture
This may be represented in a drawing.
- Define a user. 
- Define the verbs/actions the user is goig to do. For example: *Sign up*, *Log in*, *Check info*, *Send*, *View*.
- Create a visuals (screenshots) of what the display will look like after the user's action above.
- Define what the application should do after the user's action. For example: *Store*, *Set up*, *Fetch*, *Send*.
- Mark with a special sign (a lock) the actions that require secure transactions.

### High Level Architecture
Use a drawing to define the flow.
- Define a user
- Define application layers (View, Web, Services, Persistence)
- What components will intercept user's request?
