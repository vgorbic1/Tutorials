## Overflow
The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
* **visible**	The overflow is not clipped. It renders outside the element's box. This is default.
* **hidden**	The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.
* **scroll**	The overflow is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content.
* **auto**	If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content.
* **initial**	Sets this property to its default value.
* **inherit**	Inherits this property from its parent element.

* **What happens if an image is larger than its containing element?**
* The `clip` property lets you specify a rectangle to clip an absolutely positioned element.
