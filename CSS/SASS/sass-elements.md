## Elements, Classes, and Selectors
In CSS, a pseudo-element is used to style parts of an element, for example:
- Styling the content ```::before``` or ```::after``` the content of an element.
- Using a pseudo class such as ```:hover``` to set the properties of an element when the user's mouse is touching the area of the element.
