##.NET
.NET platform was announced in July 2000. It is a development framework that provides a new way to create Windows applications. It also facilitates creating web applications quickly and easily. The platform consists of three separate product groups:

- New .NET-enabled non-PC devices, from cell phones to game boxes.

Central to the .NET platform is a development environment known as the .NET framework. The framework specifies how .NET programming constructs such as intrinsic types, classes, and interfaces are implemented. 

The .NET framework sits on top of any flavor of the Windows OS. The most important are CLR and Framwork Class Library (FCL) that provides big number of predefined types or classes to use in your programs.

The .NET technology for creating web applications is called ASP.NET. It is the next generation from ASP (Active Server Pages) and composed of Web Forms and  Web Services. C# is generally acknowledged to be the language of choice for ASP.NET development.
