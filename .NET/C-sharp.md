## C# Language
C# was created specifically for .NET. The language is sutable to develop:
- Console applications, which display no graphics.
- Windows applications, which use standard Windows interface.
- Web applications, which can be accessed with a browser.

The language is simple, but is highly expressive when it comes to implementing modern programming concepts. Developed by Anders Hejlsberg (also created Turbo Pascal) and Scott Wiltamuth.
