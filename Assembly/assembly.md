## Assembly

There is actually only one language ever needed, which is called "machine language" or "machine code". It looks like this:
```
0010000100100011
```
Assembly language was created as an exact shorthand for machine level coding, so that you wouldn't have to count *0*s and *1*s 
all day. It works the same as machine level code: with instructions and operands.

Each assembly language was created for just one processor or family of processors as the instructions mapped directly to 
opcodes run by the processor.
