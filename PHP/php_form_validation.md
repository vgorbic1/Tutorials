## Form Validation
The two primary approaches to validating an input are whitelisting and blacklisting. Blacklisting involves checking if the input contains unacceptable data while whitelisting checks if the input contains acceptable data. Since whitelisting tends to be both safer and more robust, it should be preferred for any validation routine. 

Input validation is frequently accompanied by a related process we call Filtering. Where validation just checks if data is valid (giving either a positive or negative result), Filtering changes the data being validated to meet the validation rules being applied. Where you must filter, always filter before validation and never after.

HTML forms are able to impose constraints on the input used to complete the form. You can restrict choices using a option list, restrict a value using a mininum and maximum allowed number, and set a maximum length for text. HTML5 is even more expressive. 
```
<form method="post" name="signup">
    <input name="fname" placeholder="First Name" required />
    <input name="lname" placeholder="Last Name" required />
    <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="someone@example.com" required />
    <input type="url" name="website" required />
    <input name="birthday" type="date" pattern="^d{1,2}/d{1,2}/d{2}$" />
    <select name="country" required>
        <option>Rep. Of Ireland</option>
        <option>United Kingdom</option>
    </select>
    <input type="number" size="3" name="countpets" min="0" max="100" value="1" required />
    <textarea name="foundus" maxlength="140"></textarea>
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```
However, any attacker can create a custom form that doesnâ€™t include any of the constraints in your original form markup.
