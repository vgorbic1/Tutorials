## Form Validation
The two primary approaches to validating an input are whitelisting and blacklisting. Blacklisting involves checking if the input contains unacceptable data while whitelisting checks if the input contains acceptable data. Since whitelisting tends to be both safer and more robust, it should be preferred for any validation routine.
