##MVC Frameworks

####CodeIgniter
Developed and maintained by EllisLab and can be described as an open source (though, tightly controlled) framework that forms the base for EllisLab’s premium CMS (Content Management System) ExpressionEngine. It strives to maintain a tiny footprint, excellent developer documentation, and high code quality.

####Zend Framework
Zend Framework is an extensive collection of loosely coupled code libraries that can form the basis of an MVC architecture. Zend Framework takes quite a bit of effort to understand and master relative to other popular MVC frameworks. It is developed by Zend Technologies and enjoys all the benefits of a large, stable community and wide adoption. Whereas frameworks like CodeIgniter strive to be lightweight, favoring just the essentials, Zend Framework includes libraries that help developers utilize a wide range of third-party services and APIs.

####CacePHP
CakePHP is arguably the most popular of the three frameworks. Unlike the previous two frameworks, it is not governed by any one corporate entity. It has a large community and is widely adopted. It favors convention over configuration, which means a lot of the finer details are assumed and automated. This is apparent in every area of the framework, and you will often find yourself wondering how CakePHP is
doing something you didn’t ask it to do, both good and bad. This means you can develop an application quickly, but also that you might have a hard time when you need to make very specific changes.
