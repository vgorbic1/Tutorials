## Strings
In PHP strings in single quotes and double quotes are used differently.
- Single quotes represent simple strings, in which almost all characters are used literally.
- Double quotes encapsulate complex strings that allow for special escape sequences and for variable substitution, ahich makes it possible to embed the value of a variable deirctly in a string, without the need for any special operator.
