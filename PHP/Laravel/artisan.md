## Artisan
Laravel comes bundled with a command-line tool called Artisan.
Artisan can be used to run migrations, create users and other
database records manually, and perform many other manual, onetime
tasks.

Under the `make` namespace, Artisan provides tools for generating
skeleton files for a variety of system files. Thatâ€™s what allows us to
run `php artisan make:controller` for example.
