## Laravel Valet

Install Valet (see the docs for the latest installation instruction—it’s under very active
development at this time of writing), and point it at one or more directories where
your sites will live. I ran valet park from my ~/Sites directory, which is where I put
all of my under-development apps. Now, you can just add .dev to the end of the directory
name and visit it in your browser.

Valet makes it easy to serve all folders in a given folder as “FOLDERNAME.dev”
using valet park, to serve just a single folder using valet link, to open the Valetserved
domain for a folder using valet open, to serve the Valet site with HTTPS
using valet secure, and to open an ngrok tunnel so you can share your site with
others with valet share.
