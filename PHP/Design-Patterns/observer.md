##Observer
The Observer pattern describes a structure in which there are senders and receivers. When something changes in the state of a sender, it sends a message to the receivers associated with it, usually by calling one of their
functions.

The most practical uses of this pattern are to implement event-based (asynchronous) software, and to facilitate loose coupling in classes only related by changes in application state.
