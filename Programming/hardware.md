## Hardware

#### Microprocessor
Microprocessor click sets thepace fore executing instructions. Gigahertz (GHz) billion cycle per second. Cloc cycle is not the same as number instructions. 

CPU - central processing unit. Clockspeed comparisons are only valid when comparing processors within the same chip family.

Multicore processor - more than one processing unit.
- 2.4 GHz i5 processor has 2 cores total 4.8 GHz.
- 1.6 GHz i7 processor has 4 cores total 6.4 GHz.

CPU cache is a special high-speed memory. Level 1 cache is the fastest L2 and L3 slower.

Word Size is a number of bits the processor can handle at one time. 64-bit processor has 64-bit register and processes 64 bits a time.

#### Memory
Random access memory. Holds raw data waiting to be processed by CPU and program instructions for that data. RAM consist of capacitors. A chrged capacitor holds 1 and represent 1 bit. Each bank of capacitors holds 8 bits (1 byte) and has a unique address. RAM is volatile, reqiring electrical power to hold the data. DRAM (Dynamic RAM) Capacity measures in GB. SDRAM is the most popular type of RAM.

ROM (Read-only Memory) sits in a simple cirquitry. It is permanent and non-volatile. It is hard-wired and uses battery all th time. EEPROM (Electrically erasible programmable ROM) is a user modifiable ROM. Usually content bootstrap loader (PC -> BIOS)

#### Data Storage System
Data goes from a storage device to RAM. Access time is the time takes to locate data on the storage media and read it. Measured in ms. Data transfer rate is amount of data that can be moved from storage media to computer. Measured in MBps (megabytes per second)

- CD - 650 MB (infrared laser)
- DVD - 4.7 GB (red laser)
- Blue-ray - 25 GB (blue laser)

Optical storage (light "lands" and dark "pits" spots). Lifespan is more than 30 years.

Solid stage storage or flash memory is non-volatile. Solid stage drive my be used as a hard drive.

#### Displays
- LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) filters light through backlighting, produced by cold cathode fluorecent lamps. Not environmently riendly.
- LED (Light Emitting diode) backlighting is produced by diodes. Dot pitch (dp) is a measure of image clarity. .26 or .23 is good. Response rate is time it takes to change from black to  white and back to black. 5ms or less is good.
