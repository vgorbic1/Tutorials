## Databases
Database is a collection of data.
- Data mininig - computer algorithms that analyse information to get previously unknown and potentially useful information.
- Data warehouse - repository for data from many different databases.
- Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a datat analysis technique that allows for quick answers to complex questions.
- Big Data - huge collection of data that are difficult to process, analyse and manage.

#### Database models
- unstructured file (like a website) 
- structured file (like a library catalog) used by most databases.

**Flat file**

A single two-dimensional table of data elements. Like an email address book or a playlist. Impossible to use any relationships.

**Hierarchial**

Allows one-to-one and one-to-many relationships linked in hierarchial structures. Like a DOM structure of a web page.

**Network**

Uses mesh-like structure that has many-to-many relationships. Like DNS that keeps track of internet IP addresses.

**Relational**

Stores data is a collection of related tables. Very flexible model.

**Dimensional**

Uses dimensions (layers) to organize data into a system. Usually three ore more dimensions. Used in data warehouses.

**Object**

Object-oriented model that stores data as objects which can be groped in classes and defined by atributes and methods.

**Object-Relational**

A combination os object-oriented and relational concepts. Can store unique types of data and program code to access that data.

#### Types of DBMS
- XML DBMS - organized to handling data in XML format
- ODMBM - object database model
- RDBMS - relational database model
