## Programming

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a programming paradigm since 1960s, but get most attention since 1980s with C++.

Core idea: Programs should be composed of individual elements (blocks) or *objects*, each of which
has ability to communicate with other around it. Each object may have the facility to store data internally.
Objects with the same characteristics belong to the same class. Class defines properies of the objects and
gives them certain functionality. 

The three sturdy pillars of OOP are:
- **Encapsulation**. Each class should be fully define the state and responsibilities of that type.
- **Specialization**. Allows to establish hierarchical relationships amont your classes. 
- **Polymorphism**. Allows to treat a group of objects in a similar way and have the objects sort out how to implement the programming instructions.

#### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
The steps before programming anything are analysis and design. 
- **Analysis** is the process of understanding and detailing the problem you are trying to solve. 
- **Design** is the actual planning of solution.

One powerful analysis technique is to create what are called use-case scenarious, in which you describe in some detail how the system will be used. Among the other considerations in the analysis period are determining your success factors (how do you know that your program works) and writing a specification of your porgram's requirements.

Once you have analyzed the problem, you design the solution. Imagining the classes you will use and their inter-relationships is key to the design process.
