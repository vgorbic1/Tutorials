## Programming

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a programming paradigm since 1960s, but get most attention since 1980s with C++.

Core idea: Programs should be composed of individual elements (blocks) or *objects*, each of which
has ability to communicate with other around it. Each object may have the facility to store data internally.
Objects with the same characteristics belong to the same class. Class defines properies of the objects and
gives them certain functionality. 

The three sturdy pillars of OOP are:
- **Encapsulation**. Each class should be fully define the state and responsibilities of that type.
- **Specialization**. Allows to establish hierarchical relationships amont your classes. 
- **Polymorphism**. Allows to treat a group of objects in a similar way and have the objects sort out how to implement the programming instructions.
