## Facade Pattern
The façade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
With façade pattern you can take a complex subsystem and make it easier to use by implementing a Façade class that provides one, more reasonable interface. A façade not only simplifies an interface, it decouples a client form a subsystem of components.
