## Iterator Pattern
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. The pattern relies on an Iterator interface. It also places the task of traversal on the iterator object, not on the aggregate, which simplifies and interface and implementation, and places the responsibility where it should be.
