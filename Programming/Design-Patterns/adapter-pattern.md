Adapter Pattern
The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adopter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
-	The client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface.
-	The adapter translates the request into one or more calls on the adaptee using the adaptee interface.
-	The client receives the results of the call and never knows there is an adapter doing the translation.
There are two kinds of adapters: object adapters and class adapters. Object adapter:

Class adapter works with multiple inheritance, so it is not possible with Java:
