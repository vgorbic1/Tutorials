## Levels of Competence
Four Stages of Competence by A. Maslow:
- Conscious incompetence. You don't know something. But you know that you are ignorant. 
- Conscious competence. You know something. And you know that you know it. To use this skill you have to make a conscious effort and concentrate.
- Unconscious competence. This is when your knowledge of a topic is so great that it has become second nature. You are no longer aware that you are using your expertise.
- Unconscious incompetence. You don't know that you don't know something. You are ignorant of your ignorance.

## Learning Models
Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, postulated by S and H Dreyfus in 1980.
- **Novice**. A complete newbie. Novices want to get results fast, but have no experience to guide them in doing so. They look for rules they can follow by rote, and have no judgement to tell whether those rules are good or bad. Novices have no knowledge of a topic (yet).
- **Advanced beginner**. At this level, some experience has led to learning; you can break free from fules a little and try tasks on your own. But perception is still limited, and you'll get stuck when things go wrong. At this level there is a better understanding of where to get answers, but you are still not at a level where you can compreheend the bigger picture. The beginner can't focus out irrelevant details; as far as they're concerned everything and anything could be important to the problem at hand. Beginners rapidly gain explicit knowledge.
- **Competent**. This stage sees you with a mental model of the problem domain; you have mapped the knowledge base, have bdgun to associate its parts, and understand the relative importance of different aspects. At this point, you actively seek out new rules to formulate a plan of attack, and begin to see the limitation of those rules.
- **Proficient**. Proficient people can correct previous errors and reflect on their experiences to work better in the future. Now it is easy to identify and focus only of the issues that really matter, confidently ignoring irrelevant details. Here we see the person has gained significant tacit knowledege, which hard to transfer by exposition, that is only gained by experience and deep understanding.
- **Expert**. There are very few experts. They are authorities on a subject; they know it completely, and can use this skill interlinked with other skills. They can teach others. Experts have intuition, so rather than needing rules, they naturally see an answer, even if they can't articulate why it's the best solution.
