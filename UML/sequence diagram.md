## Sequence Diagram
Sequence diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram 
(subset to UML) that shows interactions over time.

Sequence diagrams are sometimes known as **event diagrams** or **event scenarios**.

Sequence diagrams are a popular dynamic modeling solution in UML because 
they specifically focus on **lifelines**, or the processes and objects that 
live simultaneously, and the messages exchanged between them to perform a 
function before the lifeline ends.

A sequence diagram **describes how (and in what order) a group of objects works together**.

There are two types of sequence diagrams: 
- UML diagrams
- Code-based diagrams (sourced from programming code)

### When to use Sequence Diagram?
If you need to:
- Represent the details of a UML use case.
- Model the logic of a sophisticated procedure, function, or operation.
- See how objects and components interact with each other to complete a process.
- Plan and understand the detailed functionality of an existing or future scenario.
