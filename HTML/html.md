## HTML5

#### Some tips
Always add a trailing slash to subfolder references:
```
href="google.com/folder/"
```
Otherwise, you generate two requests to the server: first, it will add the slash and second, create a new real request.

To refresh a page every 30 seconds:
```
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
```

Specify width and height for img element. In this case the space gor the image will be reserved by a browser, and the layout won't change.
