## Pointers
Pointer is a variable that stores an address of another variable.
To declare a pointer to point to a variable with Integer (int) type:
```
int *p;
```
In C language a pointer takes 4 bytes of memory. 

To assign a variable to a pointer:
```
int a;
int *p = &a;
```
Now the pointer `p` holds the memory address of vairable `a`.
