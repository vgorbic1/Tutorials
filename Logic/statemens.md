##Statements
In logic and mathematics, a *statement* is a sentence that is TRUE or FALSE but not both.
```
1 + 1 = 2 is a statement because it is TRUE
1 + 1 = 1 is a statement because it is FALSE
x + 1 = 5x is not a statement because it is TRUE for some values and FALSE for others
```
Any sentence may be presented by letter 'p'.

Any sentence with *x* in it will be marked `p(x)`.

This is a statement:
```
For all integers x, x + 1 is an integer.
```
The phrase `For all` is called *quantifier* and is represented in logic with a symbol &#8704;

If the leter `I` represents a set of integers, we can write a statement: &#8704; x in I, x + 1 is an integer.

`Universal statement` asserts that a certain property holds for **every** element in a set. 

The phrase `There exists` is another qualifier and is represented in logic with a symbol &#398;

`Existential statement` asserts that there exists at least one element of a set for which a certain property holds.
