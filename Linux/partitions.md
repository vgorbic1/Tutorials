## Partitions
Having several partitions provides higher security against disaster
- ```.data``` partition is a normal Linux data with root partition.
- ```.swap``` partition is an extra memory on hard drive.

Standard root partition has 100-500 MB. Standard instalation requires 250 MB. Swap partition is accessible only by the system and is hidden.
