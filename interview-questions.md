#### General Questions
**What are the differences between GET and POST methods in form submitting?**

A GET mostly used to retrieve data, usually through a URL where all parameters are visible. A POST is used for writing data and transfers info within the body of request, instead of URL.

**How can we submit a form without a submit button?**

Using JavaScript: onClick event on the page triggers a function submit() in the script.

Using PHP: using a header() function with a parameter location:script.php
