## Registering Application Users
An administration panel is built into the WordPress framework, allowing us to log
in through the admin screen. Therefore, we have a registration area, which can be
used to add new users by providing a username and e-mail.

We need to extend the WordPress registration process, in order to cater to various
requirements in a web application.
- We need to explore the possibilities of adding WordPress registration to the frontend.
- We need to look for the possibility of adding new
fields to the existing WordPress registration form.
- we need to see how we can extend the current process to include user activation.
