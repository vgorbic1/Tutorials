## A Development Plan

Planning is a crucial task in web development, in which we will save a lot of time
and avoid potential risks in the long run. First, we need to get a basic idea about the
goal of this application, features and functionalities, and the structure of components
to see how it fits into WordPress.

### Sample Application Goals and Target Audience Statement
Developers and designers who work online as freelancers know the importance
of a personal profile to show your skills for improved reputation. However, most
people, including experts who work full-time jobs don't maintain such profiles, and
hence get unnoticed among co-developers. The application developed throughout
this book is intended to provide the opportunity for web professionals to create
their public profiles and connect with the experts in the field.

### Planning the Application
Basically, our application consists of both frontend and backend, which is common
to most web applications. In the frontend, both registered and unregistered users
will have different functionalities based on their user roles. The following diagram
shows the structure of our application home page:

The backend will be developed by customizing the built-in admin features of
WordPress. Existing and new functionalities of the admin area will be customized
based on the user role permissions.
