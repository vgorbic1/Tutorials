## The limitations of choosing WordPress for app development.
- Lack of support for MVC: As a developer,
you need to figure out ways to work with WordPress in order to suit web
applications. If you are someone who cannot work without MVC, WordPress
may not be the best solution for your application.
- Database migration: If you are well experienced in web development, you
will have a pretty good idea about the importance of choosing databases
considering the possibilities of migrating to another one in later stages. This
can be a limitation in WordPress as it's built in to work with MySQL database.
Using it with another database will be quite difficult, if not impossible. So,
if you need the database to be migrated to some other database, WordPress
will not be the best solution.
- Performance: It's important to plan ahead on the performance considerations as it can come
through internal and external reasons. WordPress has a built-in database
which is designed to suit CMS
functionality and sticking with the same tables for different types of projects
will not provide the optimized table structure. Therefore, performance might
be a limitation for critical applications interacting with millions of records
each day, unless you optimize your caching, indexing, and other database
optimization strategies.
- Architecture: WordPress runs on an event-driven architecture, packed
with features. Often developers misuse the hooks without proper planning,
affecting the performance of the application. So, you have to be responsible
in planning the database and necessary hooks in order to avoid performance
overheads.
- Regular Updates: WordPress has a very active community involving its
development for new features and fixing the issues in existing features.
Once a new version of core is released, plugin developers will also update
their plugins to be compatible with the latest version. Hence, you need to
perform additional tasks to update core, themes, and plugins, which can be a
limitation when you don't have a proper maintenance team.
- Object Oriented Development: Experienced web developers will always
look for object-oriented frameworks for development. WordPress started its
coding with procedural architecture and now moving rapidly towards object
oriented architecture. So, there will be a mix of both procedural and objectoriented
code. WordPress also uses a hook-based architecture to provide
functionality for both procedural and object-oriented codes. Developers
who are familiar with other PHP frameworks might find it difficult to come
to terms with the mix of procedural and object-oriented code as well as the
hook-based architecture. So, you have to decide whether you are comfortable
with its existing coding styles.
