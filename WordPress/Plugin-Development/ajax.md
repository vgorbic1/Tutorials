## Ajax
In the WordPress interface when you write a new post, you can add or remove tags and categories
without refreshing the whole page: This is Ajax.

Ajax is a web development technique that enables a page to retrieve data asynchronously, in the
background, and to update parts of the page without reloading it. The word originally stands as
an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML, but despite its name the use of XML is not
actually mandatory. You can sometimes read it as AJAX, but the form Ajax is more widely adopted.

Ajax is not a technology or a programming language but a group of technologies: It involves client -
side scripts such as JavaScript and server - side script such as PHP that outputs content in HTML,
CSS, XML, and JSON â€” or actually mostly anything.
