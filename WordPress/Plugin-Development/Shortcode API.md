## Shortcode API
A shortcode is a simple tag syntax between square brackets, such as `[something]` ,
used in posts. At render time when the post is displayed, the shortcode is dynamically replaced
with a more complex and user - defined content.

You must not register for your own use the following shortcodes: 
```
[wp_caption] [caption] [gallery] [embed]
```
These are registered by WordPress.
