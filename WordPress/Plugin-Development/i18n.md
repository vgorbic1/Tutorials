## Internationalization (i18n)
Internationalization is the act of preparing your plugin for use in any number of languages.
Using the built - in translation functions in WordPress, you can easily make your plugin
available to a wide variety of people without any knowledge of your users’ written languages.
The process of translation is handled for you by WordPress.

Internationalization deals with making sure strings of text are wrapped in specific function calls. It
is the practice of making text ready for localization. Localization is the process of translating text for a specific locale.
It’s a plugin’s job to handle internationalization so that localization can take place.

The first step to make your plugin translatable is to use the `load_plugin_textdomain()` function.
This function tells WordPress to load a translation file if it exists for the user’s language.
```php
<?php
load_plugin_textdomain( $domain, $abs_rel_path, $plugin_rel_path );
?>
- $domain — A unique string that identifi es text in your plugin that has been prepared for
translation. For organizational purposes, you should give this the same value as the name of
your plugin folder.
- $abs_rel_path — A deprecated parameter that should no longer be used. Setting this to
false is best.
- $plugin_rel_path — Relative path to the translations of your plugin from the user’s plugin
directory ( WP_PLUGIN_DIR ).

If you were creating a plugin with a folder name of boj-plugin, your code would like this:
```php
<?php
load_plugin_textdomain( ‘boj-plugin’, false, ‘boj-plugin/languages’ );
?>
```
Every time you add textual content in your plugin, you should wrap it in one of the WordPress translation
functions.

The `__()` function works by making your text ready for translation and returning it for use in PHP:
```php
$text = __( ‘WordPress is a wonderful publishing platform.’, ‘boj-plugin’ );
```
The `_e()` function makes your text ready for localization. It works similarly to echo in PHP by displaying text
on the screen:
```php
_e( ‘This site runs off the coolest platform ever & mdash; WordPress.’, ‘boj-plugin’ );
```
You can use the `_n()` function to differentiate between the singular and plural forms of text.
Not only will this function figure out which form should be used, it also will enable you to make
each form translatable. Both the singular and plural forms need to be internationalized because the
order that words appear for plural and singular forms is different in various languages.
```php
printf( _n(‘You have published %s post.’, ‘You have published %s posts.’, $count, ‘boj-plugin’ ), $count );
```
### Creating translation files
You need to create a default translation fi le to kick start the translation process for potential translators.
One of the most common tools for plugin developers is Poedit. It has a simple, point-and-click
interface that enables developers to create a POT fi le from their plugin.

For the cleanest, most organized system, create an extra directory in your plugin folder called
`languages`. When you release your plugin, you can store your default translation files in this folder.
When translators send you translation files for your plugin, you simply drop those files in the
languages folder. Be sure to add both the PO file (for translators) and MO file (for WordPress) of
the translation you’re given.
