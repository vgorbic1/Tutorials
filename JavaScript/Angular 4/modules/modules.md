## Modules
Modules bundle certain functionality so it can be imported later.
`app.module.ts` contains several properties:
- **declarations** - defines which components, derectives, or pipes our app (or this particular module) uses.
- **imports** - defines which other modules does this module use.
- **providers** - defines which services we can use in this module (mostly for the whole application).
- **bootstrap** -defines what is the root component for the application.

**import** describe what are the Types and where they are located in the filesystem.
