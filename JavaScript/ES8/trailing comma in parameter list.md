## Trailing commas in function parameters 
JavaScript has allowed trailing commas in array literals since the beginning, 
and later added them to object literals (ECMAScript 5) and most recently 
(ECMAScript 2017) to function parameters.
```js
function f(p) {}
function f(p,) {} 

(p) => {};
(p,) => {};
```
