## JSON
JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is the easiest format to work with data in JavaScript. There is only one type of collections in JavaScript - an array. The square brackets represent the collection:
```javascript
students = []
```
In XML:
```xml
<students>
 <student></student>
  <student></student>
  <student></student>
  <student></student>
</students>
```
