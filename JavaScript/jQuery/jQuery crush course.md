## jQuery Crush Course
### The jQuery Object
In old school JavaScript, to select elements that your CSS would simply call `#container a`, you may have written code like:
```js
document.getElementById('container').getElementsByTagName('a')
```
With jQuery, you can now simply write the following:
```js
$('#container a')
```
The dollar $ sign is a shortcut to the jQuery object.
