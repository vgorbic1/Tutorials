## Objec Oriented Programming
Java is a functional programming language, not object oriented. There are no classes or scopes in JavaScript.
However, there is a way to implement OO features to JavaScript.

#### Class
To crate a class use a function definition with uppercase name of the function (Classname):
```javascript
function Dog() {
}
```
