## Circular Linked List
A linked list in which the last node points to the first node is called a circular linked list.  
In a circular linked list with more than one node, it is convenient to make the pointer first point to 
the last node of the list.  Then we can access both the first and the last nodes by using first:  first 
points to the last node and first->link points to the first node.
