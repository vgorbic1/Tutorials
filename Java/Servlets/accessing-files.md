## Accessing Files
If you store a file in a directory that's web accessible, such as the root directory for a web application, any user who enters the correct URL can access
the file. However, the WEB-INF directory and its subdirectories aren't directly
web-accessible. As a result, if you want to keep a file private, you can store it in
the WEB-INF directory or one of its subdirectories. Or, you can restrict access to
the file or directory as described in chapter 16.
