## Redirection And Forwarding
- Forward is happening on the Server-side.
- Redirect is happening via HTTP and Browser.

#### Forwarding
Servlet or JSP uses the RequestDispatcher to transfer control. Control is transferred entirely on the server. 
No network traffic is involved. The user does not see the address of the destination JSP page!
