## MySQL create new database

####Step One
Create a new database
```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE sample;
```
Select the database you just created
```
mysql> use sample
```
Create a user to access the database you just created. 
You can name this user whatever you like, and give it whatever 
password you like.
```
mysql> CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';
```
Give the new user "crud" privileges on the database.
```
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON sample.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
```
