## Modifiers
Modifiers control behavior and/or accessibility of classes, interfaces, variables, and methods.

### Class Modifiers
There is a limited set of modifiers that can be applied to classes:
- public
- abstract
- final
The public modifier makes the class accessible from any package. If this modifier is not specified, the class will be accessible from the package it was declared.
