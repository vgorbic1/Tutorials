## Programmatic Security
Declarative security is all well and good. In fact, it is by far the most common
approach to Web application security. But, what if you want your servlets to be completely
independent of any server-specific settings such as password files? Or, what if
you want to let users in various roles access a particular resource but customize the
data depending on the role that they are in? Or, what if you want to authenticate
users other than by requiring an exact match from a fixed set of usernames and passwords?
Thatâ€™s where programmatic security comes in.
