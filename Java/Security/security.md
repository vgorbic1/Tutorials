**Authentication** is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be.

**Authorizaion** is to give official permission for or approval to.

**User** is a human operator or a process that is trying to access an object. In a secured building it would be a person with a keycard that only has access to the doors that open with that card.

**Subject** is similar to an actor when creating a UML diagram. The subject is the person or other entity that has access to an object.
In a secured building it would be a person with a keycard that only has access to the doors that open with that card.

**Principal** is a user, computer, or any entity that can ba authenticated by the system. Authenticated using an identifier id of some sort.

**Group** is a collection of principals with the same level of required access.

**Role** is the access that a principal or group is allowed to have, what they can do and how they can interact with a system.

**Policy** is a document or set of rules that outlines the roles, laws, and practices for computer network access, an association between a web logic resource and one or more users and security roles.

**Realm** is a way in which access is restricted or permitted. Realm provides authentication of credential data. A Realm may be tables of a database or a collection of the roles and permissions for that database.

**Credential** is a proof of identity. In a secured building this is a keycard with a picture ID.
