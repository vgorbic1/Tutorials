## Hibernate
Hibernate is a high-performance Object/Relational persistence and query service which is licensed under the open source GNU Lesser 
General Public License (LGPL) and is free to download. Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database 
tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities. 
Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for JAVA and it raised as an open source persistent framework created 
by Gavin King in 2001. Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the work in persisting 
those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns:

#### JDBC
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity and provides a set of Java API for accessing the relational databases from Java program.

**Pros of JDBC:**	
-	Clean and simple SQL processing
- Good performance with large data
- Very good for small applications
- Simple syntax so easy to learn
**Cons of JDBC:**
- Complex if it is used in large projects
- Large programming overhead
- No encapsulation
- Hard to implement MVC concept
- Query is DBMS specific
