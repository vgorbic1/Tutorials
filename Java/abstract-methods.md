## Abstract Methods
An abstract method means the method must be overriden. The reason to use an abstract method is polymorphism. An abstract method has no body. 
```java
public abstract void eat();
```
If you declare an abstract method, you must mark the class abstract as well. You cn't have an abstract method in a non-abstract class.
