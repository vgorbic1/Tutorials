## Testing with jUnit
Software unit tests help the developer to verify that the logic of a piece of the program is correct. Running tests automatically helps to identify software regressions introduced by changes in the source code. Having a high test coverage of your code allows you to continue developing features without having to perform lots of manual tests. The code which is tested is typically called the code under test. If you are testing an application, this is called the application under test. A unit test is a piece of code written by a developer that executes a specific functionality in the code to be tested and asserts a certain behavior or state. The percentage of code which is tested by unit tests is typically called test coverage. Unit tests are not suitable for testing complex user interface or component inteaction. For this you should develop integration tests.

An integration test has the target to test the behavior of a component or the integration between a set of components. The term functional test is sometimes used as synonym for integration test. Integration tests check that the whole system works as intended, therefore they are reducing the need for intensive manual tests.
