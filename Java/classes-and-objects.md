##Classes and Objects
Java is an Object-Oriented language, meaning that its primary purpose is to manipulate objects. An Object is a logical entity 
consisting of data and code. All objects are built from templates called classes, which makes them central to the Java language. 
Any functionality you wish to implement in Java, must be constructed as a class.
