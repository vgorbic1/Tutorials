## Unit testing with jUnit 
In IntelliJ IDEA project.

## Install jUnit library:
- Add the junit jars to our project. File >> Project Structure >> Global Libraries.
- Click "+" to add a new library.
- Navigate to the IntelliJ application installation directory >> Contents >> lib.
- Select 3 jars: junit.jar, junit-4.12.jar, hamcrest-core-1.3.jar.
- The jars are now a global library.
- Create a tests directory. Make sure it is marked as "Test Root".
- Create classes in your tests directory to test your real code. 
- Ideally, you will have one test class for each real class.
