## OpenAuth
So, many users prefer the use of social logins to authenticate
themselves and try the application before deciding to register.
OAuth is an open standard for authorization. OAuth provides client applications
a 'secure delegated access' to server resources on behalf of a resource owner.
Designed specifically to work with
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to
be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of
the resource owner, or end-user. The client then uses the access token to access the
protected resources hosted by the resource server.
