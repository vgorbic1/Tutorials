## Create a Theme from Scratch
Working from scratch will help you to gain a better understanding of the theming system.

#### Create the Folder Structure
First you need to create a folder for your new theme. This should go in `sites/all/themes` or `sites/yoursite/themes` depending on whether this theme should be available to all sites on your installation or just one site. Give the folder a unique name that describes your theme (no spaces).
