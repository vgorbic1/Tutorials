## Core Concepts
A *node* is the generic term for a piece of content on your web site. The *content type* of the node will define what fields are included with it. Depending on the type of node, different fields will be attached. For example, a basic Page content type has attached fields such as title and body. Other examples of content type are: Book pages for use in Books, Discussion topics in forums, Blog pages in blogs, and News articles.

An *entity type* is a useful abstraction to group together fields. Entity types are used to store and display data, which can be nodes (content), comments, taxonomy terms, user profiles, or something custom developed.

Each *comment* is typically a small piece of content that a user submits, attached to a particular node. 

Pages on your Drupal site are laid out in *regions*. These can include the header, footer, sidebars, and main content regions. Your theme may define additional regions.

*Blocks* are discrete chunks of information that are displayed in the regions of your site's pages. Blocks can take the form of static chunks of HTML or text, menus (which are for site navigation), the output from modules (e.g. hot forum topics), or dynamic listings that you've created yourself (e.g. a list of upcoming events).
