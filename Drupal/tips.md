## Some useful tips

It is a best practice to avoid creating site content with user/1. That is so because it is awkward when responsibility for site maintenance done as User/1 needs to change to a new person if the original User/1 wrote content that still needs to be associated with him/her. The content written by the original author would have to then be assigned to a new user account. It's better to simply create that second account immediately after installing the site.
