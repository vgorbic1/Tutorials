## Useful Modules

#### Context
Do you need to do something different with one part of your site? Context is ideal for dividing your site into sections, based on various criteria, and apply different "reactions" to those sections. You can create a section based on content type, menu path, taxonomy term, user roles, and more. Reactions include:
* add blocks to regions;
* control which menu item is active;
* add different titles and subtitles;
* add a unique class to the HTML body tag.

#### jCarousel
This module makes the popular jCarousel plug-in available to Drupal. jCarousel is normally used to display and scroll multiple images in a row. There are many configuration options, and it's simple to turn any view into a jCarousel.

jCarousel isn't just for images either. Pretty much anything Views can output can be put into a jCarousel. There are several simple themes included, or you can completely override the designs with your own images and CSS.

#### Views slideshow
This is another way of creating slideshows in various configurations. It is very similar to jCarousel, and has very similar usage and configuration options. Instead of displaying several images in a row, however, Views Slideshow is best used when displaying and scrolling one image at a time.

Wondering which carousel module to use? jCaoursel is great if you want to display and scroll multiple images in a row (or column). Views slideshow is better if you want to display one image at a time. Both modules allow you to include other content â€“ pretty much anything you can add to a View, you can add to a slideshow.

#### Colorbox
There are many JavaScript Lightbox scripts out there. These modules allow you to link a photo (or text, or whatever), to a large version of the image, in a pop-up overlay. Colorbox is one of the few options with a well-maintained Drupal implementation. The module integrates well with both fields and Views. You can easily set an image field or View to display in a colorbox. It also provides a very powerful colorbox trigger field to Views, which can allow you to do some pretty neat things.

Lightbox2 and Shadowbox are two other useful options. I personally found Colorbox to have more usable controls within Drupal than Lightbox2, and Shadowbox requires a lisence for commercial use. The comparison of Lightbox-type modules is currently rather out of date but may be helpful.

#### Menu block
It's simple to display a flat list of menu links, but what if you want to something different? What if you want the whole tree? Or part of a tree? It's common for a design to show a top-level set of links in a horizontal menu, with related sub-navigation in a sidebar. How do you do that?

Enter Menu block. This module can output sections of a menu tree in different configurations. You can also configure menu blocks to follow the active page, which makes it possible to create one menu block for each sub-section of a menu. Make sense? I hope so. The configuration options can be rather confusing, but with a little fliddling you can get just about any menu output you could wish for.
