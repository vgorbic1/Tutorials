## Useful Modules

#### Context
Do you need to do something different with one part of your site? Context is ideal for dividing your site into sections, based on various criteria, and apply different "reactions" to those sections. You can create a section based on content type, menu path, taxonomy term, user roles, and more. Reactions include:
* add blocks to regions;
* control which menu item is active;
* add different titles and subtitles;
* add a unique class to the HTML body tag.
