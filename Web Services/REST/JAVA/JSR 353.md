## Java API for processing JSON using JSR 353

Java EE 7 has standardized the JSON processing APIs with **Java Specification Request (JSR)**, that is, **JSR 353 -
Java API for JSON Processing**. This JSR offers portable APIs to parse, generate, transform, and
query JSON data. The JSR 353 APIs can be classified into two categories on the basis of the
processing model followed by the APIs:
- Object model API
- Streaming model API

Dependencies for JSR 353 - Java API for JSON Processing are listed at
[https://jsonp.java.net/download.html](https://jsonp.java.net/download.html).

### JSR 353 Object Model
This category of APIs generates an in-memory tree model for JSON data and then, starts processing it
as instructed by the client. This is conceptually similar to the Document Object Model (DOM) API
for XML.

Refer to the complete list of the object model APIs available in JSR 353 at
[http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/json/package-summary.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/json/package-summary.html).
