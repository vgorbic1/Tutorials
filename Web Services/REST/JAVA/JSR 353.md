## Java API for processing JSON using JSR 353

Java EE 7 has standardized the JSON processing APIs with **Java Specification Request (JSR)**, that is, **JSR 353 -
Java API for JSON Processing**. This JSR offers portable APIs to parse, generate, transform, and
query JSON data. The JSR 353 APIs can be classified into two categories on the basis of the
processing model followed by the APIs:
- [Object model API](https://github.com/vgorbic1/Tutorials/blob/master/Web%20Services/REST/JAVA/JSR%20353%20Object%20Model)
- [Streaming model API](https://github.com/vgorbic1/Tutorials/blob/master/Web%20Services/REST/JAVA/JSR%20353%20Streaming%20Model.md)

Dependencies for JSR 353 - Java API for JSON Processing are listed at
