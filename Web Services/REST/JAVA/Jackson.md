## Using the Jackson API for Processing JSON
Jackson is a multipurpose data processing Java library. The primary capability of this tool is the
support for processing JSON.

Jackson provides the following three alternative methods for processing JSON:
- **Tree model APIs**: This method provides APIs for building a tree representation of a JSON
document
- **Data binding API**: This method provides APIs for converting a JSON document into and from
Java objects
- **Streaming API**: This method provides streaming APIs for reading and writing a JSON
document
