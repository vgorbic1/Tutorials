## Java tools and frameworks for building RESTful web services

The Java API for RESTful web services (JAX-RS) is the Java API for creating RESTful web
services following the REST architectural pattern.

JAX-RS is a part of the
Java Platform Enterprise Edition (Java EE) platform and is designed to be a standard and portable
solution. There are many reference implementations available for JAX-RS today. Some of the most
popular implementations are Jersey, Apache CXF, RESTEasy, and Restlet.

Most of the frameworks in the preceding list, such as Jersey and Apache CXF,
are not just limited to reference implementations of the JAX-RS specifications, but they also offer
many additional features on top of the specifications.

Apart from the JAX-RS-based frameworks (or extensions built on top of JAX-RS), you may also find
some promising nonstandard (not based on JAX-RS) Java REST frameworks on the market. Some
such frameworks are as follows:
- **RESTX** is an open source Java REST framework and is
primarily focused on the server-side REST API development. This is relatively new on the
market and simplifies the REST API development.
- **Spark** is another framework that falls into this category. It is a Java web framework with support
for building REST APIs. Spark 2.0 is built using Java 8, leveraging all the latest improvements
of the Java language.
- **Play** is a Java (and Scala)-based web application framework with inherent support for building RESTful web services.
