## Ordered Linked List
The following operations are usually performed on an ordered list:
1)	Initialize the list.
2)	Check whether the list is empty.
3)	Output the list.
4)	Output the list in the reverse order.
5)	Destroy the list.
6)	Search the list for a given item.
7)	Insert an item in the list.
8)	Delete an item from the list.
9)	Find the length of the list.
10)	Make a copy of the list.

Many of the operations on ordered linked lists are similar to the operations on the operations on unsorted lists.  We only need to modify the search, insert, and delete operations.  Therefore, we derive the class to define the ordered linked list as an ADT from the class linkedListType.
