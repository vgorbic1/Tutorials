```
Request path: *.php
Module: FastCgiModule
Executable: "C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe" (here should be the full path to php-cgi.exe of PHP installation)
Name: PHP via FastCGI
```
- You should note that if you donâ€™t see in the modules space, "FastCgiModule" drop-down menu, it entails that
the module has either not been enabled or registered. To confirm that FastCGI module has been registered, 
access the IIS configuration `file%WINDIR%windowssystem32configapplicationHost.config`and confirm the line is 
also in the section of the <globalmodules>.
```
<add name="FastCgiModule" image="%windir%System32inetsrviisfcgi.dll" />
```
In that exact file, confirm that the <modules> section has had the FastCGI module added to it like the highlighted path below.
```
<add name="FastCgiModule" />
```
- Click "Yes"
- Check the PHP availability with `phpinfo();`
